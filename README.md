# Lukas' dotfiles

* I maintain this repo as *my* dotfiles, but I'm keenly aware people are using it for theirs.
* You're quite welcome to make suggestions, however I may decline if it's not of personal value to me.

## Setup

I would not suggest you just wholesale use my dotfiles. But there's a few files where there's great goodies you can steal.

I am using [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) as my dotfiles manager and this one I also recommend to you.
